# Motivations

To some extent, every single architecture initiative that is based on an Enterprise Architecture model starts from scratch, and typically locked to an software tool or service. Through the selected tool, an architecture metamodel is defined (or adopted from standards like Archimate¬Æ), architecture domains are identified, template diagrams are developed, and architecture data to be used is identified, activities that become as time consuming as the architecture initiative itself, before the actual work starts.

It feels like a significant amount of effort even before the first architecture artifact is captured. The metaphor I to use is that "the construction of road that takes us to the to-be built facility is bigger than the facility itself". 

As a result, business organizations developed a "traumatic disorder" in respect to architecture initiatives, perceiving the benefits being small than the effort and costs. Often enterprise architecture teams are assembled and disassembled due to their perceived cost/benefit, and organizations unknowingly (or accepting it) loose tacit and coded knowledge of their business, information and technnology architectures.

# Purpose

The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate Enterprise Architecture modeling could be streamlined by easily integrating already existing architecture knowledege, managed in a de-centralized form by different teams and organizations, reusing as "building blocks" to be reused, enriched, modified to address the need of a given organization. Same examples:

* Business Capability Models: ACORD, APQC, ISACA COBIT, The Open Group IT4IT
* Technology Services: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
* Implementation: PMI PMBok
* Applications: ServiceNow CMDB

# How

This experiment will be using small set of architectural guiding principles:

* It will not re-invent the wheel - leverage existing standards and approaches
* It will leverage Archimate¬Æ modeling language - it is the most prevalent across EA practitioner community

# Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

* Still in progress
