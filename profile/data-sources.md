# Envisioned Data Sources

One of the challenges of architecture modeling using ArchiMateÂ® is the re-creation of existing concepts managed by external organizations. Business Capability models, such as ACORD and APQC, are good are good opportunities for federated architedture modeling through the Fed-EA's definition for a federation file format, which would include globally unique identifiers, versioning, etc.

Additionally, "data sources" were considered by Fed-EA as is industry specific or organization specific, and should primarily provide data. 

Below an initial list of "best practice" data sources considered during the initial concept of Fed-EA:

## Business Capability & EnterprisePerformance Management

 * ACORD
 * APQC
 * ISACA COBIT
 * The Open Group IT4IT
   
## Applications

 * ServiceNow CMDB
