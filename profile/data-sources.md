# Envisioned Data Sources

One of the challenges of architecture modeling using ArchiMate® is the reconciliation to existing concepts already in use by a given organization. PMI PMBok is a good example, where PMI's "Project" as a concept needs to be reconciled with ArchiMate®'s "Work Package" concept, which can be used for projects and programs. 

As a vision for Fed-EA, it should allow the federatation of concepts already chosen by a organization, without introducing new ones, which are typically well established based on "best practice" frameworks. As a mechanism to accelerate enterprise architecture modeling work, it is important to adopt established approaches which already describe facets of enterprise architecture, and opportunities for improvement. The support of an organization's best practices is seen as critically important to effective communication of enterprise architecture across types of stakeholders (e.g. PMO).

Additionally, "best practice" frameworks were considered by Fed-EA as not industry specific, and do no provide data. Through the Fed-EA's definition for a federation file format, the federation would support ArchiMate® Views, Profiles, Properties, Specializations, etc.

Below an initial list of "best practice" frameworks considered during the initial concept of Fed-EA:
